@W: MT529 :"d:\programs\hubic\maker\business\fpga\education\fipsy-fpga-edu\fipsybaseline_diamondproject\source\appmodules\freqdiv20bit.v":50:0:50:5|Found inferred clock Fipsy_Top|PIN11_inferred_clock which controls 20 sequential elements including FreqDiv20Bit_inst.count[19:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
